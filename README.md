## 🤔 Why Vibe Check?

Ever had that moment when:
- 🗑️ Cursor deleted your files and they're not in recycle bin
- 😱 You accidentally deleted a file
- 🤦 Forgot to commit even when you have Git
- 🧪 Did a quick POC without setting up Git

**Vibe Check has your back!** Cursor automatically saves versions of your files as you code. This extension lets you access that hidden history - no Git required!
